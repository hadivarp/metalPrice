# Metal Market Project

This is a simple project, likely my first one that I've decided to publish as open source.

## Overview

The project consists of both backend and frontend components. In the backend, I've utilized NestJS to make API calls to the MetalGRP website. For the frontend, I've employed React with the Create React App framework. The frontend features essential functionality such as a search box, paginations, and a toggle menu.

## Motivation

I undertook this project as a weekend endeavor, focusing on simplicity and functionality. While the project is relatively straightforward, it inevitably contains several issues. I would be honored if you could contribute to the project, identify any issues, and provide feedback.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and help make this project better!

Thank you for your interest and support!
